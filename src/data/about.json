    "about": "testHey I’m Yoel, I’m a Full Stack Developer who genuinely loves what I do. Really. I even do it for fun sometimes (as you can probably tell from this website). I have a passion for problem solving and enhancing user experience. I am an adaptive self learner with strong problem solving skills, like if Sherlock was a programmer. I am also constantly keeping up with the newest technologies like it’s the latest episode of The good place. You’re looking for the newest member of your team? You found him."
